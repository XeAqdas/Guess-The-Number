# 🎯 Guess The Number

A simple and fun **number guessing game** built in Java!  
The program randomly generates a number between **1 and 100**, and your goal is to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. When the program starts, it generates a random secret number between **1 and 100**.
2. You get **7 attempts** to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess:
   - If your guess is **too high**, it suggests trying a smaller number.
   - If your guess is **too low**, it suggests trying a bigger number.
   - If your guess is **correct**, you win! 🎉
4. If you run out of attempts, the correct number is revealed at the end.
